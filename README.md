# Grapholon

Library for graph representation of structures of any type and related operations.
Note : The name comes from the contraction of "graph" and "holon", a declination of the word ὅλος  ("holos") which is an adjective meaning "whole".
So basically the name is thought as "graphs for everything". 
It is not a litteral translation but a rough semantic evaluation that sounds nice. 
Don't send me e-mails to complain if you are proficient in Ancient Greek.

Grapholon is a Header-only library. Just copy the "Library/Include" folder wherever and enjoy.
However, the usual caveat about header-only library : only ONE version of the library can exist within one project.
